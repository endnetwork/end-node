## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **Do Not** report vulnerabilities publicly before we have had a chance to address them. Please do not create public issues or pull requests related to security vulnerabilities.

2. **Report**: Send your security report directly to us via email at [end.network.dev@gmail.com](mailto:end.network.dev@gmail.com). Provide as much detail as possible about the vulnerability, including:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Description of the issue
   - Potential impact

3. **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and will work with you to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

4. **Disclosure**: After addressing the vulnerability, we will work with you to publicly disclose the issue responsibly, if necessary.

Thank you for helping us keep the END NETWORK project secure!
